Emacs flymake support for puppet, via puppet-lint.
Deepak Giridharagopal, 2011

This code is mostly based on flymake-coffee
(https://github.com/purcell/flymake-coffee), and leverages the excellent
puppet-lint (https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-lint).

What it does:

Live, as-you-type, warning and error highlighting for your puppet code. Huzzah!

Installation:

First, you need to have flymake working in Emacs. Next, you need to have
puppet-lint in your $PATH somewhere such that emacs can execute "puppet-lint".
Take the supplied flymake-puppet.el script, and place it in your emacs load
path somewhere (which is likely ~/.emacs.d).

I use emacs' puppet-mode for editing puppet files, so the stuff I've added to
my .emacs looks like so:

    # Start puppet-mode when editing a .pp file
    (autoload 'puppet-mode "puppet-mode" "Major mode for editing puppet manifests")
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.pp$" . puppet-mode))
    (require 'flymake-puppet)
    (add-hook 'puppet-mode-hook (lambda () (flymake-puppet-load)))

You can override the command and args to use. This can e.g. be useful if you want
to invoke puppet-lint through bundler or if you want to ignore certain checks:

    (setq flymake-puppet-lint-command "bundle")
    (setq flymake-puppet-lint-args '("exec" "puppet-lint" "--no-autoloader_layout-check"))
